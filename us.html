		<h1><b>Video Game Addiction in the US</h1>

		<p>In the United States, video games addiction has been proposed since the early 90s, though the first "real" (relatively nationally representative) study conducted into the matter was undergone in 2009 by a team of researchers at Iowa State University, headed by Douglas Gentile. In the study, the researchers came to the conclusion that amongst youths of ages 8~18 who play video games, around 8.5% showed signs of behavioral addiction.<br><br>According to Gentile's study, which adapted criteria used to characterize pathological gambling, 1,178 children/teens of both genders were interviewed to determine whether they fit the definition of "pathological," meaning 6+ of the 11 symptoms. These included increasing amounts of time/money to feel the same levels of excitement, irritability/restleness when reducing playtime, escaping real world problems via video games, skipping other responsibilities/work in order to play, lying about length of play time, and stealing games/money in order to increase play time.<br><br>According to the results of the study, which used a sample of kids to represent the nation's youth population of 45 million (88% of with reportedly play video games), the results of the study seem to suggest that over 3 million kids in the US are "addicted" (or have problems of similar caliber) that call for actual assistance. However, while the study was one of the first to look into the issue, the finds were unable to answer all of the questionsâ€”relation between poor performance in school and video games, for instance, could not be strongly correlated, nor did Gentile's findings indicate true warning signs of the addiction (save for the broad ones touched upon earlier). While some experts agree that video gaming appears to be addictive, the study's findings have been considered somewhat suspect.<br><br>Historically, claims of "addiction" have never been far in the context of technological advancements, especially in the US. Television, cellphone, and internet use have all seen similar concerns, with many claims coming without research. Unsubstantiated claims and misbeliefs, as well as general misunderstanding of video games as a whole, has led to a general assumption that video games must be addictive, regardless of actual evidence to support this. As Michael Brody (chairman of media committe at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Physchiatry) mentioned, "I think kids use this just the way kids watch television, the way kids now use their cellphones. . .it's all a matter of balance."<br><br>Furthermore, while psychiatrists agree that research into these areas is warranted, much of the panic is being driven by the media rather than actual scientific evidence. According to Mark Griffiths, director of International Gaming Unit at Nottingham Trent University, contended that this statistic of 8.5% addiction was far too inflated, stating, "In all honesty, if there were 8.5 precent of children who were genuinely addicted, there would be treatment clinics all over America." Most concerning today appears to be the push to classify VG addiction, rather than the possibility of the addiction itself, with pyschologists stating that the concerns are driven by moral panic and political pressure, rather than the "addiction." As of now, the data collected surrounding VG addiction (particularly in the US, with few large-scale, conclusive studies) is simply too varied/non-scientific to be labelled factual, with numbers ranging from 0.8% all the way to 50% depending on the method of data collection/questioning.<br><br>All in all, lacking conclusive evidence, video game addiction in the US is currently not classified as a pathological disorder, with clinicians believing that the stigma surrounding them is more harmful than helpful.</p></b>
