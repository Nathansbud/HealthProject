		<h1>Video Game Addiction In Different Regions</h1>
		
		<p>Video game addiction has had a tumultuous history in the mental health scene, due to a number of arguments from both sides regarding the legtimacy of the "illness." Regardless, around the world, different regions/countries have developed their own unique cultures around video games. This, in turn, means that a number of these countries have developed differening responses to "video game addiction," with some refusing to see it as an actual mental health crisis, while others (China, for instance) have developed methods designed to "treat" the problem, with varying degrees of success. In this section, I will delve into varying regarding video game addiction rates, as well as touch upon the countries' individual responses, and propose my own solutions for the problems at hand.<br><br>The four countries that will be compared below are the United States, China, South Korea, and India. In addition, there will be a section devoted to comparisons between the nations, as well as a section detailing my own ideas for solutions/ways that the situation could be improved in each individual country.</p></b>
