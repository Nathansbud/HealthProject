		<h1>Impacts of Video Game Addiction</h1>
		
		<p>In terms of impacts of video game addiction, there are two main categories (similar to most other addictions):</p>

		<h2>Short Term Impacts</h2>

		<p>In the short term, the majority of the symptoms of video game addiction boil down to symptoms of withdrawal, including (but not necessarily limited to): anger, depression, fantasies about the game, drastic mood swings, anxiety, fear, irritability, loneliness, boredom/restlessness, and procrastination. These short term effects are often amplified those suffering from an addiction, on account of the fact that the majority of those affected tend to suffer from some form of social ostracization/handicap in the first place, which is often amplified by withdrawal.</p>

		<h2>Long Term Impacts</h2>

		<p>While video game addiction is often regarded as almost exclusively inhibiting social aspects of an addicted person—and indeed, the majority of the damage is in this area—there are also a number of long term problems which can manifest themself as a result of obsessive/compulsive video game playing. One of the most prominent of these is a direct result of the activity of playing games themselves, that being carpal tunnel: due to the rapid nature of hand movements over long periods of time, carpal tunnel is often one of the first things to manifest itself in an addicted person. In addition to carpal tunnel, extended amounts of time spent playing can lead to severe back problems and chronic headaches/migraines, due to the duration of time spent staring at screens, as well as the generally poor posture that comes as a result of slouching while using a computer. As well as that, video game addiction tends to lead to degradation in eyesight (common even in non-addicted users of technology), as well as skewed sleep schedules/insomnia (and, often, personal hygeine loss and eating irregularities).<br><br>That said, the main risks of video game addiction tend to be regarding both short and long term social isolation, as well as the development of skewed senses or reality and interpersonal relationships. As well as that, those addicted to video games often run the risk of developing gambling addictions, especially with the advent of gambling-esque systems in many modern-day online game (loot boxes/skins in most MMOs)</p>
