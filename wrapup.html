		<h1>Wrapup</h1>
		<p>Worldwide, video games addiction (especially on account of the fervor surrounding classifying it as an official mental illness/addiction, despite what many psychologists advise) has become a topic of much discussion in recent years. While conclusive statistics regarding the subject have yet to be published, even without this, there are still some potential avenues for "solutions," as it were. Although "video game addiction" might not be an official disorder, addiction itself is something that can apply to nearly anything. With video games in particular, then, the concern has always been the perceived threat of "antisocial tendencies" manifesting, and overall isolation from society. This does present itself as a major problem, as, unlike nearly all other forms of media, video games are by their very nature interactive. That said, this interactivity lends them to be an appealing alternative to the real world.<br><br>Being both incredibly engaging, and oftentimes built around game design principles that encourage spending/repeated play sessions (<a>skinner box techniques</a>, for instance), the main risk associated with video games that attempts to combat addiction have focused on in the past has been social rehabilitation. In situations where video game addiction is considered the culprit for antisocial tendencies/social isolation, video games only act as an enabler for these tendencies, rather than being the source themselves. Attempts to remove video games in these situations without tackling the other root causes will have the inverse effect of increasing social isolation, unless an effort is made to rehabilitate "affected" parties by figuring out where the social isolation originates from in the first place.<br><br>That said, as previously mentioned, it is also possible that genuine video game addiction is the case in cerain situations, which would lead to some necessary shifts. Much of the problem would stem from the fact that video game addiction is directly connected to technology addiction, and removal of all video games would basically necessitate the same for the former. Thus, methods like a modified version of "parental controls" on a platform/system wide level could set mandatory cut-off points, or regulate time in order to force some degree of management on time limits. Major consoles already possess similar features, it would just need to be more strictly enforced/implemented into non-consoles (platforms like Steam, for instance).<br><br>All in all, coming up with solutions for the problem proves difficult on account of the sort of "no man's land" video game addiction still occupies. From the evidence collected so far, it seems likely that there is something to be said for video game addiction. So far, the most compelling solutions seem to be, quite honestly, a) solving of problems OUTSIDE of the game (much like how violent games are often associated with violent tendencies, whereas they simply enable those few with these tendencies an avenue to relieve them), and b) some form of enforced time limit/cutoff.</p>
		
		<p>These ideas could change if more research was released regarding the topic/more studies were conducted into the matter. As of now, however, there seem to be few ways to really "prevent" the issue, if it can even be considered one. There is something to be said for the stigma surrounding video games, hoewver. Though not directly related to "addiction," lessening the stigma around playing games in many social circles might lead to more open discussion of games, and lead to more formalized public understanding. As what can be considered the "newest" form of media, we might have to wait and see.</p>
