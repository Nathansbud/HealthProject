		<h1><b>Video Game Addiction in India</h1>

		<p>Unfortunately, video game industry lacks the same development seen in a number of other Asian countries/the US, and as a result, little serious research/studies has been conducted into the topic over the past decade, nor are many articles availble in peer-reviewed journals. As such, actual statistics regarding video game addiction in India are spare, and those that are available tend to draw inconclusive results. With statistics on internet addiction being between 1.2~50% depending on study/method used, and few real looks at the topic in the context of video games, it can be hard to classify the issue (beyond the arguments posed regarding its status as an addiction).<br><br>That said, India serves as an interesting case study when considering the relatively recent uptick in technological developments in the country, with the country first receiving full internet service in 1995â€”today, India is nearly the second largest internet-using nation in the world, passed only by China (and followed by the US). Thus, while the argument over the legitimacy of VG addiction is ongoing, India currently sits in an interesting position of being studied while the scene is developing, rather than having been in place for a number of years. As it currently stands, however, there have been no real studies conducted into video game addiction in India, as the country's video game scene is still underdeveloped in comparison to other Asian nations.</p></b>
