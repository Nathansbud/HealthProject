		<h1><b>Overview<b></h1>

		<p>Video game addiction, as the name may suggest, is a hypothetical/proposed addiction to video game (read more about its status as hypothetical <a href="realorfalse.html" target="_self">here</a>), and is a subset of technology addiction. The addiction itself is one of impulse control (similarly to a gambling addiction), wherein the affected party has an excessive or compulsive need to play video games. While often less damaging to physical and social health in the short and long term than substance abuse or even a gambling addiction, video game addiction can bring with it a whole host of problems.<br><br>Unlike a number of other forms of addictions, with the rise in accessibility to video games (especially with the advent of the "free to play" model of video gaming, where games can be played for free but may contain in-game "microtransactions"), much of the concern regarding video game addiction stems from the ease at which they can be accessed by people of all ages (young kids included). As such, they can pose a different sort of challenge to break away from than abusable substances. Overuse of video games often stems from availability—unlike substances, abstaining from video games often requires full removal of technology.<br><br>Generally, the most addictive video games are those which allow for and encourage constant progression—"grinding". In the context of compulsive, those most susceptible to addiction tend to be those who lack regular social activity or are socially handicapped in some way (usually, via anxiety or depression). While video game addiction is not necessarily relegated to MMOs (large scale, online titles), games with these sorts of social/online components tend to be the biggest culprits, due to the ease with which a player can spend time in them. Especially amongst socially handicapped groups, these sorts of games can begin to supplements, or even replace regular social activity.x<br><br>Furthermore, this can prove more insidious, in that these types of titles often provide frequent short and long term goals, further contributing to addiction. While these games can be great tools to improve social skills (in that they allow for low stakes social interaction in a virtual environment), they can also deepen isolation from friends and family. Plus, with the rise of avenues for spending of actual money for in-game currency, addicted players can begin to spend carelessly, further causing problems outside of the context of the game.</p>
