		<h1><b>My Name is Zack<b></h1>
		<p>I'm currently a 10th grader at an international school in Mumbai, and I've recently gotten into programming. Personally, I think this is rad, because it's a pretty neat skill to have in your back pocket. Where else can I make a 90s-esque, pink site with the word "butts"? Or a game where poorly-drawn stick figures hurl words at one another? You get the idea.</p>

		<p>Right, where was I? Oh, yes, this site! The only site I've made previous was the aforementioned 90s one, so I'm here with a new, slightly more professional looking one, with (sadly) fewer rainbows, less butts, and a more pleasant color palette. So let's have a grand ol' time, shall we?</p>

		<p>The purpose of this site is for my first programming project this unit, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS. Hopefully, things don't go up in flames. Who am I kidding, they probably will at some point. But, hey, that's programming! Er, markupping? Who knows! Let's get into it, shall we?</p>
