		<h1><b>Video Game Addiction in South Korea</h1>

		<p>While a number of Asian countries lack major developments to their video game industries, South Korea is often regarded as one of the world leader in the industry, with video games comprising a significant portion of the nation's GDP. Unlike other countries, video games are considered to be a major social activity, with MMORPGs and mobile games being particularly popular in the country. In addition, the country is one of the few which has heavily been in support of major tournaments, and the eSports scene at large, with Korean players/teams often comprising a large majority of the pro gaming landscape. Korean players are often regarded as some of the best video game players in the world, in large part due to the cultural acceptance of video games at large—video games are considered more than a leisure activity.<br><br>As a result of the widespread usage of video games throughout South Korea, the country's government has tried on numerous occasions to prevent video game addiction, due to the country's mass adoption of video games amongst youth/teens. Considering it a national health concern, the government invested millions of dollars for the purpose of establishing clinics, campaigns, and programs to minimize the potential spread of addiction. To take things further, the "Cinderella Law" was implemented amongst a large majority of online games in the country, preventing teens under the age of 16 from playing online games after 10:30 PM (enforced through national indentification cards). This law was eventually scaled back in mid-2014, providing parents with the ability to determine their own cutoffs for their children<br><br>With South Korea's mass adoption of the industry on a national level, as well as the hype surrounding eSports in the country, video game addiction has been cited as one of the worst problems in South Korea, reportedly accounting for over 90% of the country's addiction cases (according to Dr. Lee Jae-Won, a neuropsychiatrist at Gangnam Eulji Hospital in Seoul). In addition, with over 25,000 active "PC Bangs" (gaming cafes), and the world's highest broadband subscription rate (25.4/100 residents, compared the 16.8 for the US), as well as an estimated 5% of youths already considered seriously addicted, the video game industry in Korea certainly appears to be the most conducive to being deemed addictive. Unlike other nations worldwide which place the moniker of "addiction" on gamers in reponse to societal and political pressure/nonacceptance, South Korea's video game addiction comes instead from the nation's adoption of video game culture and the eSports industry.<br><br>More so than perhaps any other country, South Korea's video game industry seems to indicate the true severity of video game "addiction"—at least, moreso than any other nation at present. While few serious studies have been conducted—a recurring issue in the study of video game addiction—it seems likely that video game addiction presents itself as a genuine issue is present in South Korea today.</p></b>
