		<h1><b>Source Evaluation</h1>
		<p>During the course of this project, one of the biggest walls I ran into time and time again was this idea of video games as a subset of impulse control, as well as the notion that video game addiction was entirely fictitious. As a result of this ongoing debate, as well as the general misconceptions regarding video games & "video game addiction," most of the available sources end up being higly biased, non-scientific pieces. On a similar note, few real studies exist, and those that do have received little support in the academic community. All in all, this means that it was difficult to collect real statistics, and those that I managed to find seemed to contradict one another.</p></b>
