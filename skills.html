		<h1><b>My Skills<b></h1>

		<p>Since beginning programming at school in August 2016, I've worked on a number of small projects. Initially, I was working in a language called Processing, which is a visual/art-focused language based on Java. I have worked in this for about 6 months</p>

		<p>Starting mid-January of 2017, I began working in C++, along with the visual library openFrameworks. I worked with this for about 6 months</p>

		<p>As of August 2017, I have begun working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to explore web design. So far, I have about a week of experience with these three, with the least emphasis on JS. Moving forwards, I hope to further explore JavaScript, and hopefully integrate MySQL/server code in order to create functional, hosted websites.</p>
