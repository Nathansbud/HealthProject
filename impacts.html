		<h1>Signs of Video Game Addiction</h1>
		
		<p>For the average gamer, many of the features that lead to addiction comprise a large portion of the overall gaming experience. However, for someone with game addiction/poor impulse control, these same features can be major contributing factors towards the development of an addiction. As much of the draw of games comes from the immersion, there are a number of key factors which go into game addiction, including (but not limited to):<br></p>
		
		<li>Dependence On Online Relationships</li>

		<p>While for the average gamer, forming relationships online is both a normal and enjoyable component of gameplay, this can pose a major problem. Since the affected demographic tends to be groups that are socially ostracized, these relationships often use their "loyalty"/"obligation" to online friends to justify their compulsive video game use, considering their relationships with online friends more beneficial than those in real life. This is not to say that formation of any virtual relationships should be treated as a sign of addictionâ€”rather, <i>dependence</i> on these friendships can be viewed as a potential warning sign.</p>

		<li>Social Isolation</li>

		<p>As the regularly affected party tends to be those facing social difficulty to begin with, further social isolation can often be attributed to game addiction. Games by their very nature provide virtual environment, which can simultaneously server as virtual <i>escapes</i>. As such, weakening relationships with/isolation from friends/family should be viewed as with a degree of caution, especially if this isolation comes at the cost of dropping previous hobbies/commitments for the purpose of spending increased amount of time playing games. Usually, this can be also be seen in length of play sessions, with addicted individuals generally spending massive amounts of time playing (often, far longer than initially intended). In addition, this can also lead to sleep deprivation/withdrawal, as a means to get more playtime in.</p>

		<li>Apathy From Withdrawal</li>

		<p>Like many other forms of addiction, video game addiction is not without its own withdrawal effects (which will looked at further in the <a href="symptoms">impacts/effects section)</a>. Similarly to social isolation, this tends to manifest itself in the form of apathy towards others, as well as apathy in general (especially towards non-game activities). As gaming becomes a core part of day-to-day life, addicted parties often feel restless, apathetic, and/or depressed when not in-game.<br><br>While these are far from the only symptoms, these are some of the key signs of video game addiction amongst affected individuals.</p>
